The best way i've found it is to log in using the reproduction steps, then log out and clear the application ram.
Then use the reproduce steps as described. i'd say at least 1 out 5 times this error happens. I know that it is actually grabbing the data because if you switch tabs to resources, the exercises are there. 

I'm attaching a log for mike to use.

Root cause is the app is calling ""v3/episodes/access_token"" to check for updates for all users.  This endpoint is only for HEP-lite users.   App appropriately calls ""v3/patients/sign_in"" to get the episode but on update checks the access_token is called.  There is a race condition at the time of sign-in: if the access_token failure response comes in before the sign_in response is processed, the app reports, ""Error loading program"" and will never work again.

This occurs more frequently on some codes than others.
If the race condition doesn't occur and the program loads the first time, the error response is silently ignored.  The app should be calling the sign_in api to check for updates.  Since it is not, these users' programs will never get updated.

This is a bug, so it can't have story points but it's about 2 points. 
","06/Sep/17 8:10 AM;kristin;[~admin] I don't know much about David's stories, would you be able to make the call about what should be pulled from next sprint to allow for this 2 point bug to be pulled in?

As MedBridge, we want to support ranges in MedCalc so that the common practice of clinicians entering ranges in the Builder can be supported in the app.

(We also want to finish the work on this story so that it matches documented behavior; see source code comments.)

h6. Acceptance Criteria
If range (e.g. '2-3 sets'), then MedCalc:
- Splits the string on ""-""
- trims whitespace
- parses the integer values
- computes an average of said integer values
- rounds up to nearest int.

Taking the example above, '2-3 sets', the following would occur:

2 + 3 = 5, /2 = 2.5, rounds to 3

----
*Context*
The MedBridge - ATI EMR integration allows users to select a subset of MedBridge exercises within the ATI EMR flowsheet without opening MedBridge. When the user selects the exercises, an HEP is built in MedBridge under the patient profile and saved. If a user selects, generate PDF, MedBridge will generate a PDF to send back to the user in the EMR, without having the user open MedBridge. The user has the ability add or remove exercises within the EMR. The user also has the ability to ""Customize"" the HEP, which opens the HEP builder, for that specific patient, in MedBridge. This is where the user can add exercises not synced within the ATI EMR or patient education resources. Currently, the Patient Ed is sent to the patient, but is not documented back in the EMR. This story is sending the Education name and ID back to the EMR for documentation. 

Story INT-5 will discuss deleting the patient education from the EMR. 
The ability to add a patient education piece to a patient’s HEP from within the ATI EMR is NOT included in this work.
----
*Acceptance Criteria*
# When an ATI user is logged into a patient profile in MedBridge, if they add a piece of patient education to the patient's HEP: 
#* the education name and education ID are sent back to the ATI EMR
#* The PDF includes the patient education
# Story includes testing

----
*Task Outline*
*Redundant from Steve's words* MedBridge needs to send patient education ids and names when sending a PDF, both when triggered from saving a program in MedBridge and when receiving a request from ATI in generate_hep_pdf_post()
Update MB API to send Patient Education IDs and Names to the EMR.
ATI needs to update the API on their end to accept the IDs and names.

# Attachment B: Updated functionality requirements

----
*Developer Notes*

There is a send_pdf() function in modules/Integration<Ati/Libraries/ATIPDFUpload.php that sends an HEP PDF to ATI along with json information about the exercises in the program (line 170).  For this card, we will be adding patient education json information (name and id). 

*Testing Plan*
We will need to develop a testing plan that ATI can execute on their end.

# When an ATI user is logged into their EMR and adding exercises, if the clinician adds a patient education piece, which is already mapped in the EMR with the education ID, the patient education will be added to the patient's HEP program.  
#* If the ""set patient's HEP exercises"" API sends back the id for Patient Ed ""A"", add the patient education to the HEP program.
# When an ATI users is logged into their EMR and is viewing a patient that previously had patient education assigned, they are able to delete the patient education from that patient's HEP. 
#* If an HEP contains Patient Ed ""A"", but the ""set patient's HEP exercises"" API does not send back the id for Patient Ed ""A"", remove that patient ed from the HEP.
#* If an HEP contains Patient Ed ""A"", and the ""set patient's HEP exercises"" API does send back the id for Patient Ed ""A"", keep that patient ed in the HEP.
# The HEP PDF reflects this change. 
#  there is a testing environment set up.

This functionality will live in patient_hep_exercises_post(), in API<V3/ATI.php.  ATI posts exercise ids (and now patient ed ids) to this function and we will update the HEP program for that patient accordingly.

https://medbridge.atlassian.net/browse/INT-93#
As a MedBridge developer I want to be able test the ATI integration with the client prior to launching the patient education updates so that it does not negatively impact patients or clinicians at ATI> 

*Acceptance Criteria*
# Prior to development starting, we have the proper staging endpoints and configuration id.
# The staging environment can be accessed within the MedBridge office or the ATI office locations. 
# The staging environment is maintained during the testing and development stages, but will not be maintained once the updates are launched.

*Dev Notes*
# Assumes that staging environment is up and running and the work would just be to create the special DNS routes.
# We will need to give them the endpoints, once it is completed. 
# We need to make it public. 
# After dev work completed - we are not maintaining that staging environment.

As a user, I want a way to restore default parameters for a given exercise so that I can revert to original behavior.

h6. Current Behavior
'Daily' and 'Weekly' are the only default parameters that behave as described in the AC. This was designed when we thought we'd track adherence by D/W. Other default parameters (sets, reps, hold) can be removed entirely - if they need to be added back, they must be added as custom parameters. This is not discoverable, introduces unnecessary complexity (e.g. 'reps' vs. 'rep'), and could throw off dosage calculations.

h6. Acceptance Criteria
- Sets and reps function like Daily and Weekly
- User can tap 'x' to remove default parameter
- If user taps 'x', strikethrough occurs and parameter grays out (see screenshot)
- If user inputs a number in the field for a parameter that has been grayed out, then parameter becomes available in the UI again (current behavior for defaults)

h6. Tips
# The backbone app programs.js will have everything you need
# /views/programs/edit.php has the templates
# Add property to ProgramExercise attribute like *permanent*
# Modify the template for ProgramExerciseAttributes to match the behavior of Daily and Weekly
# Move reps, sets, and hold to the area above the line like daily and weekly, custom would be below",,david.johnstone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14/Jul/17 2:38 PM;david.johnstone;Screen Shot 2017-07-14 at 2.34.12 PM.png;https://medbridge.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/11153/Screen+Shot+2017-07-14+at+2.34.12+PM.png,14/Jul/17 2:38 PM;david.johnstone;Screen Shot 2017-07-14 at 2.34.21 PM.png;https://medbridge.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/11152/Screen+Shot+2017-07-14+at+2.34.21+PM.png,,,{},,,,,,,,0|i00b3u:i,,,,Alpha Sprint F,5.0,,,,,28/Aug/17 2:29 PM;david.johnstone;Could have implications for ongoing migration work related to MedEx; this may be a t-shirt size 'Med.' to 'Large'.,29/Aug/17 10:50 AM;david.johnstone;cc [~admin],"01/Sep/17 10:16 AM;david.johnstone;[~marshall], we have questions 4 u",,,,,,,,,,
